## 1.1 Document Scope

**Document Scope** *describes the context and the goals of this document in a narrative.*

*Example:*

**Enterprise Architecture and Business Requirements**

This document describes the Enterprise Architecture of the Alpha ICT Solutions This Enterprise Architecture (EA) satisfies the business requirements from the stakeholders as documented in the Business Requirements Document.

The goal of this Enterprise Architecture document is to define the products, processes, information flows, applications, data, technologies, technical products, and techniques necessary to develop and support the future state organization/company, and to ensure that the organization elements/components are compatible and comply with the enterprise-wide standards and direction defined by the Owner/Client and Architecture Board.

This document will also:

Identify and explain the risks inherent in this Enterprise Architecture;

Define baseline sizing, archiving and performance requirements;

Identify the hardware and software specifications for the Development, Testing, QA and Production environments;

Define procedures for both data and code migration among the environments.

The Document Scope narrative also provides an overview of the efforts conducted to understand the existing technical environment and IT strategic direction and to determine how the system’s proposed technical architecture fits into them.

Where does all the data comes from and how is it managed and provided?

**Architecture Repository**
